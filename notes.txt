Run this in git bash to import pokemon_final.csv into database called pokemon and collection called pokemon
mongoimport -d pokemon -c pokemon --type csv --file pokemon_final.csv --headerline

new one:
mongoimport --db pokemon --collection pokemon --file pokemon_mongo_data.json

how to do a near query with lat longs (long comes first in coordinates [lon,lat])
db.pokemon.find({
    "loc": {
        $near: {
            $geometry:
                { type: "Point", coordinates: [74.36, 40.46] }
        }
    }
})

this needs to be run on the database, adding a '2dsphere' index on the loc column so near queries work:
db.pokemon.createIndex({loc:"2dsphere"});


Run in folder to open server at localhost:8080: python -m http.server 8080
0.0.0.0 doesn't work on your windows pc, so use 127.0.0.1 or localhost in its place to make it work



How to make this all work together:
Step 1:
I need to give them all of my code

Step 2:
Create a database in mongo db called pokemon
Step 3:
Create a collection in pokemon database called pokemon
Step 4:
Run in terminal: mongoimport --db pokemon --collection pokemon --file pokemon_mongo_data.json
Step 5: 
Run in mongo db: db.pokemon.createIndex({loc:"2dsphere"});



Step 6:
They need to run mongod
Step 7:
They need to run my python app.py
